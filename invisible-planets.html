			<h1>Invisible Planets</h1>
			<h2>COURSE</h2>
			<p><i>Typography: Expression, Structure, and Sequence</i></p>
			<p>Yale University, Spring 2020</p>
			<h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
			<p>Design a book for text of your own choice.</p>
			<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
			<p>“Invisible Planets” is the title of a Chinese short story about different imaginary planets and their unique characteristics. I designed a book for the story and its English translation primarily for English readers. The typography of each anecdote varies according to the place being described. For example, I strike through the text of the first anecdote about a planet whose natives are notorious for their constant lying. The blue strips on the edges are reminiscent of tabs in a travel guide. Words and images in the book are in blue to add a sense of otherworldliness to them. Every place described in "Invisible Planets" reflects an aspect of our own world, and so I also included pictures taken on my college campus of strange textures in familiar places. In both the photographs and the story, what seems alien is actually quite close to home.</p>
